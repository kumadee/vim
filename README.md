# Vim and Neovim

## Vim
- Set up vim on local linux. Not in containers.

## Neovim
Do one of the following options:
- Run `make basic-nvim` to have a lightweight neovim setup on your machine.
- Run `make build-nvim` to build the container image.
- Run `make start-nvim` to create a volume and start the Neovim container along with Lazyvim plugins installed.
